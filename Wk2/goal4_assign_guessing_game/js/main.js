// Create an .addEventListner event listener on the guess button to listen for a click event.
// When the guess button is clicked, evaluate your guess with the number the computer has chosen.
// Create a function to validate the users input:
// Validate that a number was entered -- AND
// Validate that the number entered is between 1 and 10
// If your guess is higher than the computer's number then display appropriate message in the HTML.
// If your guess is lower than the computer's number then display appropriate message in the HTML.
// If your guess is equal to the computer's number then display appropriate message and end the game.
// Tally all the wrong guesses and end the game after the 3rd incorrect guess and show appropriate game over message in the HTML.
// Deactivate the button by removing the event listener when the game is over.
// EXTRA CREDIT: Use a keyboard event for the ENTER button that also acts like clicking on the guess button.
